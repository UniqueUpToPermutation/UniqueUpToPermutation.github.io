title: "Paper: Operator Shifting for Noisy Elliptic Operators"
excerpt: "In the computational sciences, one must often estimate linear model parameters from data subject to noise and uncertainty. In order to improve the accuracy of linear models with noisy parameters, we propose the operator shifting framework, a collection of easy-to-implement algorithms that augment a noisy inverse operator by subtracting an additional shift term. Akin to James-Stein estimation, this reduces both bias and variance in the estimate. We develop bootstrap Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate the required shift magnitude for optimal error reduction. We  also provide a set of numerical experiments on four different graph and grid Laplacian systems."
