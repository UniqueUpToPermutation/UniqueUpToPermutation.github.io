I've finally gotten around to building my [mathematics tutorial site $$\rightarrow$$](https://permutedtutorials.vercel.app/). On this site, I will be hosting a number of mathematics tutorials on topics that interest me. This includes, but is not limited to

* Linear Algebra
* Stochastic Processes
* Optimization
* Physics
* Computer Graphics
* Model Reduction
* C++ Programming (Technically not mathematics, but why not?)

I've already updated some of my earlier tutorials on Q-processes, radiative transport, and the connections between partial differential equations and stochastic processes. I built the site with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).
